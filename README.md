## Description
An implementation to receive, moderate, store, and send end-user text messages (called `UserMessage`) on a satellite using NASA JPL's F' embedded flight software framework.

## Technologies
* C++-17
* NASA JPL's F' Flight Software Framework
* Google Test 2? for unit tests

## Features
The developed systems affords the following functionality:
* TODO

Zielbestimmung und Produkteinsatz:
* Was ist der Zweck des Produkts?
* Wo soll das Produkt eingesetzt werden? Auf einem Cubesat mit einem Raspberry Pi CM4.

AWfalldiagram:
* Ground Station Operator -> Ground Station -> Satellite
* HAM radio user -> Satellite
* Contains all functionality as a use case

Keep it short and concise!

    * Transceiver
    * Moderator
    * MessageStorage

    * CommandDispatcher
    * Framer??
  * Brief description of every component + link to their sdd
  * Design Decisions
    * Separation in components
      * MessageStorage as a separate component because it encapsulates general logic for storing `FW::Serializable` C++ objects to a file on the file system => Can be easily adapted to also storing other things than messages in the future
      * Moderator as separate component with the same interface (= same input port) as Message => Can be optionally plugged in between Transceiver and MessageStorage without neither Transceiver nor the MessageStorage knowing about it 
      * Transceiver encapsulates how loading and storing can be triggered => Can swap out the Transceiver with a different implementation to change how the satellite communicates messages with users on the ground
    * 

* Dynamic Model 
  
  The following UML sequence diagrams examplarily outline how the defined components interact to fulfill the two use-cases of receiving and downlinking messages.

  * Receive a message to store on the satellite
  * Downlink recently stored messages from the satellite

### Component Model
The system is realized by introducing three new components and by interfacing with three components of the F' framework.

The following components have been custom developed for this system:
   
  * **MessageStorage**

    Component with one port to accept a `UserMessage` to store it on the file system and another port to load a given number of recently stored `UserMessage`s.

    It is a separate component because it encapsulates the general logic for storing `Fw::Serializable` C++ objects in a file on the file system using the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) of F'. Thus, the component can easily be adapted to additionally store other types than only `UserMessage`s in the future.

* **Moderator**

	Component with one input port and one output port where `UserMessage`s given to the input port must pass a moderation check to be output on the output port. 

  It has the same interface for storing (i.e., with the same input port type) as the MessageStorage component. Thus, it can be optionally plugged in between the Transceiver component and the MessageStorage component without any of them knowing about the existence of the Moderator component. Therefore it is reasonable to have the Moderator as a separate component.

* **Transceiver**

	Component to receive `UserMessage`s from users on the ground and to downlink the `UserMessage`s stored on the satellite to users on the ground.

  It is a separate component because it encapsulates how users can trigger the loading and storing of `UserMessage`s on the satellite. Consequently, the Transceiver implementation can be swapped out to change how the satellite communicates messages with users on the ground.

The system uses the following framework components to integrate its functionality into the F' reference flight software system `Ref`:
* **Svc.CommandDispatcher**: Receives commands sent to the satellite by ground station operators and forwards them to the appropriate component.
* **Svc.ActiveRateGroup**: Calls the Transceiver component's `scheduleDownlink` port at a fixed rate to consistently trigger downlinking the `UserMessage`s stored on the satellite.
*  **Svc.Framer**: Handles downlinking a given F' type to the ground station.
  <!-- TODO: Is Svc.Framer correct? -->


## Installation

Also provide System Requirements
- Must use an operating system for which an implementation for the Operating Systems Abstraction Layer (OSAL) of F' is provided. F' comes with such an implementation for Linux out-of-the-box. Implementations for other operating systems, like VWorks, ... # TODO
- A C++17 compiler

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

<!-- TODO: Can profit from fprime installation guide by including some of their instructions + finally linking to them -->

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
Draft:
* How to use it in an existing F' Flight Software System? Developers that wish to use the code of this repository can swap out the implementations for these components to fit the UserMessage system into their own  F' flight software system (see [Used Framwork Components](#component-model)).

### Example: Send Message to Satellite
