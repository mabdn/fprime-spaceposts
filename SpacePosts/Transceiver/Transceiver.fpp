module SpacePosts {

  @ Component to receive `SpacePost`s from users on the ground 
  @ and to downlink the `SpacePost`s stored on the satellite to users on the ground.
  @
  @ It is a separate component because it encapsulates how users can trigger the loading
  @ and storing of `SpacePost`s on the satellite. Consequently, the Transceiver 
  @ implementation can be swapped out to change how the satellite communicates messages with users on the ground.

    @ Store the given SpacePosts on the satellite
    guarded command STORE_MESSAGE(
        @ The message to store on the satellite
        msg: SpacePost
    )

    @ Initiate the downlink of the last SpacePosts stored on the satellite by a ground station operator 
    @
    @ See design requirement F-TRA-020
    guarded command DOWNLINK_LAST_MESSAGES_GDS

    @ Initiate the downlink of the last SpacePosts stored on the satellite by a HAM radio user 
    @
    @ Separate from DOWNLINK_LAST_MESSAGES_GDS because the HAM radio user access to this command may be restricted
    @ by:
    @ * ALLOW_HAMUSER_DOWNLINK_CMD parameter: Ground station operators can disable the DOWNLINK_LAST_MESSAGES_HAMUSER 
    @   command in a way that it does not trigger a downlink.
    @ * DOWNLINK_COOLDOWN_TIME parameter: Ground station operators can set a cooldown time after which must have passed
    @   since the last downlink. Otherwise, the HAM radio user downlink command does not trigger a downlink. 
    @
    @ See design requirement F-TRA-021
    guarded command DOWNLINK_LAST_MESSAGES_HAMUSER


    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Parameters

    @ Enables and disables the DOWNLINK_LAST_MESSAGES_HAMUSER command.
    @
    @ See design requirements F-TRA-022 and F-TRA-023
    param ALLOW_HAMUSER_DOWNLINK_CMD: bool default false

    @ The number of seconds that must have passed since the last downlink for the HAM radio user downlink command 
    @ to be executed when received.
    @
    @ I.e., if DOWNLINK_LAST_MESSAGES_HAMUSER is received and the last downlink was performed less than
    @ DOWNLINK_COOLDOWN_TIME seconds ago, no downlink is performed.
