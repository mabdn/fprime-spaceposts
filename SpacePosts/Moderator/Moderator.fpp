module SpacePosts {

  @ Component with one input port and one output port where `UserMessage`s given to the input port must
  @ pass a moderation check to be output on the output port. 
  @
  @ It has the same interface for storing (i.e., with the same input port type) as the MessageStorage 
  @ component. Thus, it can be optionally plugged in between the Transceiver component and the MessageStorage
  @ component without any of them knowing about the existence of the Moderator component. 
  @ Therefore it is reasonable to have the Moderator as a separate component.
