# MessageStorage Component Documentation
## Summary
<!-- - Alice: What was the project about?
- Alice: What skills did he learn that apply to our job offering? -->

The `MessageStorage` component is a passive F' component responsible for storing and loading messages of type
`UserMessage`
on the file system.

## Interface to Other Components
<!-- Danny: How do I use the component? -->
### Component Diagram
![MessageStorage Component Diagram](MessageStorage_ComponentDiagram.png)
### Ports
Other components which want to use `MessageStorage` to store a message need to call its ports.
* `storeMessage`: Stores a single given message
* `loadMessageLastN`: Loads a given number of the most recently stored messages. I.e., messages are handled in last-in-first-out order. The loaded messages are returned in a batch which is defined as a type.
* `loadMessageFromIndex`: Loads a single message from a provided index. The index is an indetifier number internal to 
  the component. This port is only useful if the user knows what index they are looking for, e.g. from an event or 
  from telemetry data emitted by the component

### Events and Telemetry
The component emits an event every time 
* it successfully stores a message (`MESSAGE_STORE_COMPLETE`),
* it fails to store a message (`MESSAGE_STORE_FAILED`),
* it successfully loads a message (`MESSAGE_LOAD_COMPLETE`),
* it fails to load a message (`MESSAGE_LOAD_FAILED`).

The name in the brackets is the type of the emitted event. For every cause of an event, a different type is used. 

Furthermore, the component emits additional events and telemetry upon success or failure of some internal opertions. For a full definition, refer to `Ref/BBSMessageStorage/BBSMessageStorage.fpp`.


## Dependencies
<!-- - OSAL: OS::File and OS::Directory -->
This component depends on the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) of F'. More specifically, it uses `OS::File`,
`OS::Directory`, and `OS::FileSystem` which means that these two classes must be implemented for the underlying
Operating System.

### Internal Architecture
--- 




### Indexing
---

**Challenge**
* The component needs to give messages a file name that is different from the messages already stored.
* It 
also must be able iterate the messages backwards in order of arrival to provide the capability to load the last n
stored messages. 
* Assume no index can be infered from the message content.

**Resulting Design Decision**

The component assigns every message an index when starts an attempt to store the message. The index is a `U32` and simply counted upwards every time a new message is about to be stored. 

The index bijectively defines the file name. The file name format is '`<id>.bbsmsg`' where `<id>` is replaced with the index number.

The index is starts counting at 1 past the last index of a message found in the storage directory upon start-up of the component. If the component does not find any messages upon start-up, the index starts at 1. Restoring the index is implemented in `restoreIndexFromHighestStoredIndexFoundInDirectory()`.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the index counter never exceeds the maximum of `U32`. If it does, it is wrapped around to 0. The assumption is realistic as `U32` can count over 4 trillion messages which is multiple magnitudes more than what we expect as defined in the mission success criteria.



### Message Type

The component treats the message type `UserMessage` as a black-box
